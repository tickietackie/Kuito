# Kuito
A mobile learning App

# Deployment of Kuito

To deploy this app you need the expo app from the appstore as this is a managed project.
You can donwload it from here https://expo.io/learn.

Android

The easiest way to open the project in Androide is to visit this website https://expo.io/@tickietackie/Kuito. You can scan the QR Code with an Android device or directly open the app from there. The app is opened in the expo App and can be used instantly.

IOS

On IOS published projects cannot be opened. Therefore I opened a test account where I published the App. Open the expo app, dismiss the welcome page and head over to profile. Login in wiht username Kuito and the password bovsoP-xapxib-4zamqu. You should now see the project and by clicking on it you should be able to start the project.

Furthermore you can git clone the project and follow the steps on https://expo.io/learn to set up expo and run the project locally via expo start.
